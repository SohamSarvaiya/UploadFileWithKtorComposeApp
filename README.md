The project is built with a clean architecture approach, ensuring modularity and maintainability. Key components include:

ViewModel: Handles user interactions and manages file upload states.
File Readers Class: Processes files for compatibility and prepares them for upload.
Repository: Manages the interaction between the ViewModel and the Ktor client, encapsulating API calls.
Ktor: A modern framework for networking in Kotlin, making it easy to handle HTTP requests and responses.
The app utilizes the latest version of the Ktor library, ensuring compatibility and leveraging its advanced features for efficient file uploading. Itâ€™s designed to be simple and intuitive, with a focus on demonstrating how to integrate Ktor for file operations in Android applications.
